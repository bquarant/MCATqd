# Because I write pretty janky code, here's some commands to run after a fresh boot on 
# Heroku

# Push code up to heroku
git push heroku master

# Create DB if needed
heroku run bundle exec rake db:create

# Update DB to the latest and freshes
heroku run bundle exec rake db:migrate

# Create the first question to prevent errors from being thrown
heroku run console
q = Question.new
q.save

# Web site should be able to boot now without errors

# Create a new account user regular login process

# Set this new account as a admin
heroku run console
u = User.find(1)
u.attributes = { :is_admin => 1 }
u.save

# ^ still isn't working properly...
